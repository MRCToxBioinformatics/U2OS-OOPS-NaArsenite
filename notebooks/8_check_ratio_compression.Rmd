We have a concern that our fold changes are being 'compressed'. If so, this will be due to co-isolation. We can check this at the PSM level. Let's start by reading in the PSM level data.
```{r}
total_psm <- read_delim("../raTotal_Arsenide_TMT_PSMs.txt")
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
